## üöÄ Technologies Used

* **Frontend Framework:** [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (App Router) - For server-side rendering, routing, and a robust React environment.
* **UI Library:** [React](https://react.dev/) - For building interactive user interfaces.
* **Styling:** [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - A utility-first CSS framework for rapid and consistent UI development.
* **Dashboard Grid System:** [React Grid Layout](https://react-grid-layout.github.io/react-grid-layout/examples/) - Enables the draggable and resizable widget functionality.
* **Charting & Visualization:**
    * [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) - For powerful, low-level data-driven document manipulation and custom visualizations.
    * [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/) - For popular and easy-to-use chart types.
* **Data Processing:** `papaparse` (for CSV parsing), native JSON parsing.
* **AI Integration:** (Crucially, **specify what AI service/API you are using here**, e.g., OpenAI API, Google Gemini API, custom LLM, etc.)
* **State Management:** React Hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useCallback`, `useRef`).
* **Unique IDs:** `uuid` - For generating unique identifiers for widgets.
* **Data Persistence:** `localStorage` - For saving dashboard state in the browser.

## üì¶ Installation & Local Setup

Follow these steps to get InsightFlow AI running on your local machine:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [your-repository-url-for-insightflow-ai]
    cd insightflow-ai
    ```

2.  **Install project dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    # or
    pnpm install
    ```

3.  **Configure Environment Variables:**
    If your AI integration requires an API key or other sensitive information, create a `.env.local` file in the root of your project:
    ```bash
    # Example for an AI API key
    NEXT_PUBLIC_AI_API_KEY=your_actual_ai_api_key_here
    # Add any other necessary environment variables here
    ```
    *(Replace `your_actual_ai_api_key_here` with your valid API key)*

4.  **Start the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    # or
    pnpm dev
    ```

    The application should now be accessible at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your web browser.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Project Structure Overview

It looks like you've pasted the content of the README.md file into the chat, but it's not quite in the correct markdown format for the code blocks and the image. Also, it seems like you might have accidentally included some unrelated text at the very end ("Deep Research Canvas Your Rajiv Gandhi University of Knowledge TechnoloI").

I will regenerate the README.md in the proper Markdown format, fixing those small issues.

Here's the corrected and properly formatted README.md content for InsightFlow AI. Just copy and paste this directly into a file named README.md in the root of your project.
